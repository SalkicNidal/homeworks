  <h3><p style="color:blue">Liverpool will assess Jordan Henderson s foot injury ahead of Monday nights trip to Arsenal to determine  whether he can feature at the Emirates. <p></h3>

    <p id="text_color">The captain was withdrawn in the early stages of the second half during the victory over Bournemouth earlier this week due to the knock.
    <br>
    Rodgers confirmed: “We’re just assessing Jordan day by day.
    “He’s obviously had the problem with his foot, but we’ll see how he goes over the next 48 hours and take it from there.”    <br>
    <br>
    Rodgers has no other fresh fitness concerns as his squad gears up for the journey to north London.
    <br>
    The manager added: “There are just one or two players that we’ll assess, but hopefully we’ll be otherwise unchanged.”

 <h3><p style="color:blue">Liverpool’s team spirit has been one of the underlying factors behind their 100 per cent start to the season, according to Joe Gomez – and they’ll travel to Arsenal on Monday high on confidence.<p></h3>

   <p id="text_color">The Reds have picked up maximum points from their opening two matches with a couple of 1-0 triumphs over Stoke City and Bournemouth – results achieved in determined fashion.

Now, as Brendan Rodgers prepare for their next big test at the Emirates, Gomez has highlighted why he believes the camaraderie within the dressing room has been key so far.

In an exclusive chat with Liverpoolfc.com, he said: “Obviously I’ve only just came in this season, but judging from the way the dressing room is, there are some great characters and leaders in the team and that’s helping us.

“Everyone has bonded well and everyone is willing to play for each other and the manager.

“The support has been quality and amazing for me to get to see what the Liverpool supporters are like. It’s been a real driving force and hopefully that can continue.

“Everyone is confident and I think the whole team is ready. We’re looking forward to each game at the moment and hopefully we can do well [against Arsenal].

Gomez, a summer signing from Charlton Athletic, has completed the full 90 minutes in each of Liverpool’s opening two Barclays Premier League matches.

If that trend continues in North London, the 18-year-old acknowledges he could be lining up in the biggest game of his fledgling career to date.

“It probably would be,” he said. “It should be a good one and I am looking forward to it – it’s a massive game and I think everyone is looking forward to it.

“The main thing is to try and get the three points and keep our winning streak going, so hopefully we can get another result – and it’ll be another good experience for me.”</p>
