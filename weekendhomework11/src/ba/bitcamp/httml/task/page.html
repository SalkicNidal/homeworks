      <h3 style="color:orange">History:</h3>
<div class="history">
  <h3> Believe it or not, there was a time when Anfield was the home of the Blues and not the Reds!</h3>
    <p id="text_color">Everton were one of the first members of the Football League but when they were evicted from Anfield in 1892, stadium owner John Houlding was left with an empty ground and no team to play in it.So Houlding decided to form his own team and, on 3 June 1892, Liverpool Football Club was born.
   </p>

 <h3>Liverpool won their first ever LeagueChampionship in 1901.</h3>

   <p id="text_color">A run of nine wins and three draws from their  final twelve matches saw the Reds crowned  champions.The team were given a heroes welcome when they returned to the city with the trophy and captain Alex Raisbeck was carried through the streets on the shoulders of fans!</p>


 <h3>
   It may be hard to believe but Liverpool have not always played in an all-red kit.</h3>

   <p id="text_color">In fact, it wasn't until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to replace the white shorts and socks with red ones as he felt an all-red kit strip would make his players look more scary to the opposition!So, in December 1964 Liverpool wore all-red for the first time in a European Cup match with Anderlecht, changing the image of football forever.</p>


 <h3>
   Over 25,000 Liverpool fans travelled to Hillsborough for the FA Cup semi-final.</h3>
 
  <p id ="text_color">Ninety six of them never returned.<br>
   They'll Never Walk Alone.</p>


 <h3>Liverpool claimed their fifth European Cup after a memorable triumph over AC Milan.</h3>

  <p id="text_color">The Reds had overcome all odds to reach the final, but were losing 3-0 by half-time. However, an incredible second-half saw goals from Gerrard, Smicer and Alonso drew Liverpool level before they went on to win the cup on penalties.An unforgettable homecoming followed and the trophy returned to Anfield, where it would remain as Liverpool had won it for keeps!
