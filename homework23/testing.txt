President Cristina Kirchner at the site of the explosion
President Cristina Kirchner at the site of the explosion
A gas explosion in a residential area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It was caused by a large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the cause of the explosion, and particularly the role of Litoral Gas, the natural-gas provider for Rosario. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had recently returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited the site of the explosion, and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns. Pope Francis sent a letter of condolence to the Archbishop of Rosario that was read during a mass and procession for Saint Cajetan at Plaza 25 de Mayo, Rosario's civic center. (Full article...)

Eurasian sparrowhawk	
A male Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) capturing a common starling. This small bird of prey species is found throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World, and though it specialises in catching woodland birds it can be found in any habitat. Males tend to take smaller birds, including tits, finches, and sparrows, while the larger females catch primarily thrushes and starlings.
